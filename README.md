This is my third web app, and the one that reflects my current programming skill.

Things I wanted to accomplish here:
- use more advanced OOP - this is my first attempt to implement the MVC design pattern with more understanding of how to design & use classes & objects
- I have controllers classes, model classes and view classes here. I have constructors that actually do something.
- I have a Database class, Session and Auth class - a more abstract approach than having a Car class only
- I have learned and started to use Regular Expressions
- This is my first approach to JavaScript & jQuery - I have used it to manipulate the DOM, validate inputs & process AJAX requests
- AJAX is a big thing for me here - understanding how it works & how the JSON format works as well
- Frontend design is non-existent here - it's not really my stronghold, but also not my focus at this time in the project, maybe later

It's still in early stages of construction - I have a previous version, built without MVC that had a little more functionality working, but I'll just update this version the more things I do with MVC.
